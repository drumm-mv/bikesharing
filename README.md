# Bikesharing
Using Tableau to build visualizations to tell the story of data.

## Overview:
Provide a Tableau story to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

Click here [NYC Citibike Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16630376654200/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to reach the tableau story for this analysis.

## Results:

The majority of trip durations do not exceed an hour, with the average rider using the bikes for 5-10 minute intervals.

This heatmap shows that during business work days (Mon-Fri) the bike use is highest around normal morning (8-9am) and evening(5-7pm) commute times, and on weekends the usage is higher during midday (11am-4pm).

The "Trips by Gender" heatmap shows that the majority of users are identified as male.

The "User Trips by Gender by Weekday" heatmap reiterates the percentage of "male" riders, but also shows an nearly even use by all genders among non-subscribed customers.

## Summary:
The subscribers appear to be disproportionately male and their primary usage appears to be during the commute to and from work.

Two additional visualizations that I would perform with the given dataset would be to map the top 100 starting/ending locations by weekday as well as to map the top 100 starting/ending locations by gender.
