# Bikesharing
Using Tableau to build visualizations to tell the story of data.

## Overview:

Click here [NYC Citibike Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/shared/5JRN2T7XY?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to reach the tableau story for this analysis.

## Results:

The majority of trip durations do not exceed an hour, with the average rider using the bikes for 5-10 minute intervals.

This heatmap shows that during business work days (Mon-Fri) the bike use is highest around normal morning (8-9am) and evening(5-7pm) commute times, and on weekends the usage is higher during midday (11am-4pm).

The "Trips by Gender" heatmap shows that the majority of users are identified as male.

The "User Trips by Gender by Weekday" heatmap reiterates the percentage of "male" riders, but also shows an increased percentage of "unknown" gender among non-subscribed customers.

## Summary:
The users of bikes appears to be disproportionately male and this usage appears to be during work commute.

Two additional visualizations that I would perform with the given dataset would be to map the top 100 starting/ending locations by weekday as well as to map the top 100 starting/ending locations by gender.
